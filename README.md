## Additional
   - In larger applications, this should be broken down further to separate duties,
   [Mean.io](http://mean.io/) is a good boilerplate to see best practices and how to separate file structure.
   - [xervo.io](https://xervo.io/). This is great for doing testing and creating databases on the fly.
